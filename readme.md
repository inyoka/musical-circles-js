# Musical Circles

Simple JavaScript for taking key presses (letters only), then generating sounds and coloured circles, which shrink and disappear.  This project includes only one HTML and one CSS file.  The JavaScript needs to be placed in the HTML. See : [Colt Steele, Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)
